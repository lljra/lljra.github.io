    <h2>What is Bamboo?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>
        Bamboo is a group of tall, tree-like grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. It includes over 115 genera and more than 1,400 species. These plants thrive in tropical, subtropical, and mild temperate zones, with the highest diversity found in East and Southeast Asia, as well as in Pacific and Indian Ocean islands. Some species, such as <i>Arundinaria</i>, are even native to the southern United States, growing in dense canebrakes.

    <h2>History of Bamboo</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>
        For centuries, bamboo has been an essential part of daily life, especially in East and Southeast Asia. The seeds are edible, and young shoots are commonly used as vegetables in dishes like stir-fry. Bamboo leaves serve as animal fodder. Its strong fibers are ideal for making high-quality paper, while the stems are used to build homes, rafts, furniture, pipes, tools, and even musical instruments. Bamboo is also a cultural icon in Asian art, literature, and traditional medicine.
