      <li>
        <h4>
          The Heart of Jesus is a stunning tropical perennial known for its thin, 
          heart-shaped, and translucent leaves. Scientifically called 
          <i>Caladium bicolor</i>, it is popular as both a garden plant and a 
          houseplant. Its foliage is famous for vibrant combinations of pink, red, 
          white, and green, often featuring contrasting veins and borders that 
          resemble angel wings.

    <h2>History of Heart of Jesus</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>
          The Heart of Jesus originated in the tropical rainforests of South and 
          Central America, particularly Brazil. It was introduced to Europe in the 
          late 1700s and became highly popular during the 19th century as a 
          greenhouse plant. Today, it is cultivated worldwide, with major 
          hybridization centers in Florida and Southeast Asia producing hundreds 
          of colorful varieties.

    <h2>Benefits of Heart of Jesus</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>
          In tropical and subtropical landscapes, this plant is commonly used as a 
          shade-loving groundcover, adding bright color to areas where other plants 
          struggle to grow. It enhances shaded gardens, porches, and indoor spaces, 
          helps create a lush tropical atmosphere, and is often given symbolically 
          to represent joy and heartfelt affection.
